                Let's play a game! Each time you win, you'll get $10. If I win, you pay me $5, and you lose happiness.

                I'll play first. You'll want to play a red card that's higher than mine, or a blue card that's lower than mine. If none of your cards feel good, you can take your chances and play a random card from the deck.
            </p>
            <p id="three" class="hidden">
                Then it's my turn. I will have to play a red card that's higher than your last played card, or a blue card that's lower. If I don't, then I lose.
