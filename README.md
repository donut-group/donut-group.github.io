Description
Your Dream Friend is an engaging interactive game for users of all ages. Within the Dream World Map, we have a "Red Card, Blue Card" card game in which the user can employ logic to win and increase their money level. The game also includes a store where the user can spend money they earned on the game, a house, and a party. The party can only be entered if the user unlocks the key.
